/* Lane VKFRAME1 (2026-11-12, PRESENT FIRST): the finished GL frame goes to the screen through a Vulkan swapchain
 * (flip model: MAILBOX, else IMMEDIATE; FIFO only when vsync is on) instead of SwapBuffers, which blocked 1.5 ms of
 * build 82's 4.4 ms frame at the empty spot (windowed GL goes through the compositor's copy).
 * How: a child window over the view's client area (mouse and keys pass through to the view), its own Vulkan
 * device on GL's GPU (the ray-tracing device has no swapchain extension), a ring of 3 RGBA8 images GL imported.
 * GL resolves its back buffer into the ring image (one blit) and signals; Vulkan waits, blits into the swapchain
 * image (the y flip) and presents. Off: WW_VKPRESENT_RED=1, or Settings > Ray tracing device > Vulkan Present
 * unticked: GL's SwapBuffers. Log line `vk present:`. */
